# BONBON-RAIN-CASCADE

Dynamic cascade of bonbons falling from above, frozen mid-motion.

---

## MAIN PROMPT

```
Using the six uploaded bonbon photographs as reference, create dynamic action product photography with bonbons cascading downward in frozen mid-fall moment. Maintain each bonbon's exact original shape, coating finish, color, and all decorative elements precisely as shown in the uploaded images. Bonbons captured at various heights (15-5cm above surface) creating vertical cascade pattern. Top bonbons higher and smaller in frame, bottom bonbons lower and larger showing perspective. Shot from front 30-degree angle showing cascade trajectory. Subtle motion blur on highest bonbons, sharp focus on lower ones. Realistic shadows beneath each bonbon indicating height. One bonbon just touching surface at bottom. Dynamic energy with elegant control.

Image-to-Image Instructions:
- Preserve each bonbon's actual shape exactly as uploaded (shapes will vary)
- Maintain individual coating types: glossy, matte, textured, or specialty finishes
- Keep all decorative elements identical: patterns, gold dust, toppings
- Preserve original color tones for each piece
- Create cascade motion while maintaining authenticity
- Realistic falling physics and perspective

Cascade Composition:
- Vertical falling pattern, top to bottom trajectory
- Top bonbon: 15cm height, smaller in perspective
- Middle bonbons: 10-8-6cm heights, graduating size
- Bottom bonbons: 4-2cm heights, larger in frame
- One bonbon just landing/touching surface
- Diagonal cascade path creating dynamic flow
- Spacing varies with perspective (farther apart at top)
- Real product variety creates natural cascade diversity

Motion & Physics:
- Frozen moment captured mid-fall
- Subtle motion blur on highest bonbons (barely perceptible)
- Sharp focus on lower bonbons (closer to camera)
- Realistic falling trajectory, believable physics
- No support wires visible
- Natural gravity effect, not chaotic
- Elegant controlled cascade, not violent drop

Background & Surface (STANDARD):
- Off-white seamless backdrop (RGB 250, 248, 245)
- Subtle concrete texture at 3% opacity
- Warm minimalism aesthetic
- Infinite seamless surface

Lighting & Shadows:
- Soft studio lighting from 45° angle
- Gentle highlights appropriate to each coating type
- Realistic drop shadows beneath each bonbon
- Shadow size indicates height (larger shadow = higher bonbon)
- Professional high-speed photography lighting
- High-key with dynamic energy

Technical Quality:
- Sharp focus on lower bonbons, slight blur on highest
- Decorative details visible where sharp
- Depth of field creating perspective
- No color bleeding, crisp edges where focused
- 8K resolution, action photography quality
- Professional high-speed capture aesthetic

Style: Dynamic action shot through real products, frozen moment, playful luxury, cascade energy, editorial photography, controlled motion

## NEGATIVE PROMPT

```
bonbons on surface, static arrangement, horizontal layout, floating without motion, too many bonbons, chaotic explosion, violent motion, no perspective, flat cascade, no motion blur at all, excessive motion blur, changing shapes, altering decorative elements, different coating finishes, color modifications, packaging, dark shadows, dramatic lighting, gradient background, pure white sterile background, props, human hands, melted appearance, low resolution, blurry everywhere, unrealistic physics, shape distortion, pattern changes
