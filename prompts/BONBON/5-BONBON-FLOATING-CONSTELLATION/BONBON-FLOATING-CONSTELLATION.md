# BONBON-FLOATING-CONSTELLATION

Five bonbons suspended at different heights creating celestial orbital pattern.

---

## MAIN PROMPT

```
Using the five uploaded bonbon photographs as reference, create dynamic levitation product photography with bonbons floating at different heights in elegant orbital constellation pattern. Maintain each bonbon's exact original shape, coating finish, color, and all decorative elements precisely as shown in the uploaded images. Center bonbon hovering 8cm above surface, four surrounding bonbons at varying heights (5-10cm) creating three-dimensional constellation. Shot from front 45-degree angle showing depth and height variation. Realistic drop shadows on surface beneath each floating bonbon. Premium gravity-defying presentation.

Image-to-Image Instructions:
- Preserve each bonbon's actual shape exactly as uploaded (shapes will vary)
- Maintain individual coating types: glossy, matte, textured, or specialty finishes
- Keep all decorative elements identical: patterns, gold dust, toppings
- Preserve original color tones for each piece
- Create levitation effect while maintaining bonbon authenticity
- Realistic physics and shadows

Levitation Constellation:
- Center bonbon: main hero, 8cm height, tilted 10°
- Four orbital bonbons: surrounding at 5-7-9-10cm heights
- Orbital pattern: gentle arc arrangement around center
- Each bonbon at different height creating depth
- Slight rotation angles (5-15°) adding dynamic feel
- Frozen in suspended animation, gravity-defying moment
- Real product variety creates natural constellation diversity

Background & Surface (STANDARD):
- Off-white seamless backdrop (RGB 250, 248, 245)
- Subtle concrete texture at 3% opacity
- Warm minimalism aesthetic
- Infinite seamless surface below

Lighting & Shadows:
- Soft studio lighting from 45° angle with warm golden undertones
- Gentle highlights appropriate to each bonbon's coating
- CRITICAL: Realistic drop shadows on surface beneath all floating bonbons
- Secondary shadows showing height of levitation
- Each bonbon casts distinct shadow
- Professional depth of field
- High-key photography with elegant atmosphere

Physics & Atmosphere:
- Believable levitation physics, no support wires visible
- Clean elegant suspension, not chaotic
- Premium luxury aesthetic, sophisticated floating
- Celestial constellation metaphor
- Ultra-premium positioning

Technical Quality:
- Sharp focus on center bonbon, soft focus on orbital pieces (depth)
- Decorative details visible on all
- No color bleeding, crisp edges
- Shadows accurately placed
- 8K resolution, magazine cover quality
- Professional levitation photography

Style: Ultra-premium luxury through real products, gravity-defying elegance, celestial constellation, sophisticated dynamics, editorial hero shot
