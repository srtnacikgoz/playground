Natural organic arrangement with "just made" artisan feel and casual elegance.

---

## MAIN PROMPT

```
Using the seven uploaded bonbon photographs as reference, create professional product photography arranged in organic natural scatter pattern. Maintain each bonbon's exact original shape, coating finish, color, and all decorative elements precisely as shown in the uploaded images. Bonbons in varied forms placed casually yet elegantly across composition. Some bonbons closer together forming small clusters, others slightly separated, creating natural rhythm without rigid structure. Shot from slightly elevated overhead angle (80-degree, not perfect top-down) giving subtle depth. Organic placement suggesting artisan handcrafted story, approachable luxury.
