## MAIN PROMPT

```
Using the uploaded bonbon photograph as reference, create professional dramatic product photography with bonbon floating in massive organic cocoa powder explosion burst. Maintain the bonbon's exact original shape, coating finish, color, and all decorative elements precisely as shown in the uploaded image. Bonbon centered and hovering, surrounded by thick asymmetric cloud of fine cocoa powder and golden dust particles. Cloud spreads horizontally wider than vertical, creating dramatic cinematic burst effect. CRITICAL: Cloud must be organic irregular shape, NEVER circular ring or geometric halo. Bonbon sharp and glossy as hero, clearly visible through dust. Bright creamy off-white background (MUST NOT be dark or grey). Soft blurred oval shadow on ground beneath bonbon. Shot from front slight angle. Frozen sensory moment, artisan elegance.
