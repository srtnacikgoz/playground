Bonbons stacked vertically in precarious balanced sculpture composition.

---

## MAIN PROMPT

```
Using the four uploaded bonbon photographs as reference, create professional artistic product photography with bonbons stacked vertically in precarious balanced tower. Maintain each bonbon's exact original shape, coating finish, color, and all decorative elements precisely as shown in the uploaded images. Four bonbons carefully balanced one on top of another creating architectural sculpture. Bottom bonbon resting flat on surface, three bonbons above stacked with slight offsets (5-10mm) creating dynamic tension. Stack height: approximately 12-16cm total (varies based on bonbon shapes). Shot from straight-on profile view at eye level to mid-stack showing full tower. Gravity-defying balance, architectural elegance, impossible beauty moment.

Image-to-Image Instructions:
- Preserve each bonbon's actual shape exactly as uploaded (shapes will vary)
- Maintain individual coating types: glossy, matte, textured, or specialty finishes
- Keep all decorative elements identical: patterns, gold dust, toppings
- Preserve original color tones for each piece
- Stack bonbons maintaining their authentic forms
- All bonbons actually touching/stacked (not floating separately)

Stack Structure - Architectural:
- Bottom bonbon: resting flat on surface, foundation
- Second bonbon: placed on bottom, slight 5mm forward offset
- Third bonbon: on second, slight 8mm left offset creating lean
- Top bonbon: crown piece, slight 10mm right offset
- Total height: varies by bonbon shapes (12-16cm approx)
- Offsets create dynamic tension, not perfectly centered
- Precarious balance suggesting impossible moment
- Real bonbon shapes create natural variety in stack

Composition & Angle:
- Straight-on profile view (90-degree side angle)
- Camera at eye level to middle of stack
- Stack occupies center frame vertically
- 70% of frame height is bonbon stack
- Clean negative space around tower
- Architectural portrait orientation feel

Background & Surface (STANDARD):
- Off-white seamless backdrop (RGB 250, 248, 245)
- Subtle concrete texture at 3% opacity
- Warm minimalism aesthetic
- Infinite seamless surface
- Bottom bonbon resting on surface with full contact

Lighting:
- Soft studio lighting from 45° angle with warm golden undertones
- Gentle highlights on each bonbon's coating
- Rim lighting on edges defining stack structure
- Clean shadow beneath bottom bonbon
- Professional depth of field keeping all bonbons sharp
- High-key with architectural emphasis

Physics & Balance:
- Believable stacking (bonbons touching, not floating)
- Slight offsets create visual tension
- Gravity-defying but physically possible appearance
- No visible support structures
- Precarious elegant balance
- Architectural sculpture aesthetic
- Real product shapes create natural stacking variation

Technical Quality:
- Sharp focus on all four bonbons in stack
- Decorative details visible on each piece
- Coatings rendered beautifully on all layers
- Stack structure clearly defined
- No color bleeding, crisp edges
- 8K resolution, editorial quality
- Professional architectural product photography

Style: Architectural sculpture with real products, gravity-defying elegance, impossible beauty through authentic variety, vertical composition, artistic balance, premium iconography, memorable signature shot

## NEGATIVE PROMPT

```
bonbons scattered, horizontal arrangement, perfect centered stack (too stable), bonbons floating separately, more than four bonbons, support structures visible, bonbons not touching, changing shapes from originals, altering decorative elements, different coating finishes, color modifications, stack falling/collapsed, messy arrangement, packaging, dark shadows, dramatic lighting, gradient background, pure white sterile background, props, low resolution, blurry, stack leaning too far (about to fall), shape distortion, pattern changes
