Dramatic directional lighting creating strong geometric shadow patterns.

---

## MAIN PROMPT

```
Using the uploaded bonbon photograph as reference, create professional artistic product photography with bonbon and dramatic geometric shadow pattern. Maintain the bonbon's exact original shape, coating finish, color, and all decorative elements precisely as shown in the uploaded image. Bonbon positioned left-of-center with strong directional light from 75-degree side angle creating elongated bold shadow extending right across frame. Shadow becomes design element, clean geometric shape from bonbon's actual form contrasting with product. Shot from top-down 90-degree angle showing bonbon and shadow equally as compositional elements. Film noir elegance, light/shadow interplay, artistic minimal aesthetic.

- Maintain coating type: glossy, matte, textured, or specialty finish
