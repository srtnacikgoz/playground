## PROMPT 1: HERO SHOT - Merkezi Sunum

**İdeal Kullanım:** Yeni ürün lansmanı, signature piece, grid anchor görseli
**Kompozisyon:** Tek ürün, merkez-alt konumlandırma, ürün formunu vurgulayan açı

### DALL-E 3

```
Using uploaded image(s) as reference for the pastry type, shape, color, and decorative details.

Single pastry hero shot, 9:16 vertical aspect ratio. Position the pastry in center-lower third of frame. Choose the most flattering angle based on the pastry's form: elevated 30-degree for round/dome shapes, slight side angle for layered pastries, 45-degree for tarts showing both top decoration and side profile.

Soft natural window light from left side, creating gentle shadows that add depth without harshness. Soft off-white backdrop with subtle texture. If the pastry has glossy elements (glaze, ganache, fruit), position light to capture subtle reflections without hotspots.

Shallow depth of field keeping the pastry in sharp focus. Warm color grading complementing the pastry's natural tones. Minimal scattered elements only if appropriate to the pastry type (powdered sugar dust, cocoa, crumbs). Editorial patisserie photography, 8k quality.

## PROMPT 2: FLAT LAY - Kuşbakışı Düzen

**İdeal Kullanım:** Menu showcase, çoklu ürün, seasonal collection, variety görseli
**Kompozisyon:** 90° üstten, asimetrik organik düzen, ürün çeşitliliği

### DALL-E 3

```
Using uploaded image(s) as reference for the pastry appearance and style.

Flat lay composition from directly above (90-degree top-down), 9:16 vertical aspect ratio. Arrange pastries in natural asymmetric flow - diagonal or loose cluster arrangement rather than rigid grid. If multiple pastries, vary the spacing organically.

Soft off-white backdrop with subtle texture. Soft diffused overhead lighting creating minimal shadows. For pastries with dimensional elements (piped cream, fruit toppings, chocolate decorations), the overhead angle should capture these details clearly.

Scattered complementary elements based on pastry type: light dusting of powdered sugar, cocoa powder traces, a few berries or citrus segments if fruit-based, scattered nuts if nutty. Keep additions minimal and relevant. Sharp focus across entire frame, warm cream and natural pastry tones. Editorial food photography, 8k quality.

## PROMPT 3: 45° CLASSIC - Standart Food Photography

**İdeal Kullanım:** Günlük feed içeriği, tutarlı grid estetiği, çok amaçlı
**Kompozisyon:** Klasik 45° açı, rule of thirds, derinlik ve form dengesi

### DALL-E 3

```
Using uploaded image(s) as reference for the pastry details and characteristics.

Classic 45-degree angle food photography, 9:16 vertical aspect ratio. Position pastry using rule of thirds, slightly off-center. This angle reveals both the top decoration and side profile simultaneously - ideal for layered pastries, tarts with visible crusts, or decorated tops.

Natural side lighting from upper-left creating depth and dimension. For glazed or shiny surfaces, the 45-degree angle captures elegant light reflections. Soft off-white backdrop with subtle texture, light wooden or marble surface element visible at frame edge for context.

Soft shadows adding dimension without being harsh. Warm color grading emphasizing the pastry's natural golden, cream, chocolate, or fruit tones. Shallow depth of field with pastry sharp, background softly blurred. Film grain texture, 8k quality.
```

## PROMPT 4: SLICE/CUT - İç Yapı Reveal

**İdeal Kullanım:** Layer'lı ürünler, iç dolgu showcase, kalite/craftmanship vurgusu
**Kompozisyon:** Kesim yapılmış ürün, iç katmanlar görünür, texture reveal

### DALL-E 3

```
Using uploaded image(s) as reference for the pastry and its interior structure.

Sliced pastry composition revealing interior layers and filling, 9:16 vertical aspect ratio. One clean slice removed or pastry cut in half, showcasing the internal structure: cream layers, mousse textures, fruit fillings, cake sponge, or ganache interiors.

Position to emphasize the cross-section - the cut face should be clearly visible and well-lit. Soft natural side lighting from left illuminating the interior layers and creating subtle shadows that define each layer's depth.

Soft off-white backdrop with subtle texture. The whole pastry and slice arranged naturally - not overly styled. A clean knife or cake server at frame edge optional. Warm color grading highlighting the contrast between different interior elements (cream vs sponge vs fruit). Shallow depth of field focusing on the cut surface. Appetizing, revealing the artisan quality within. 8k quality.

### DALL-E 3

```
Using uploaded image(s) as reference for the pastry surface details and decorations.

Close-up detail shot focusing on the pastry's surface characteristics, 9:16 vertical aspect ratio. Frame filled with the most visually interesting surface area: mirror glaze reflections, piped cream textures, chocolate decorations, caramelized surfaces, fruit arrangements, or delicate garnishes.

Soft natural side lighting from left revealing surface texture - for glossy surfaces capture subtle reflections, for matte textures show the depth and dimension. Very shallow depth of field with the focal point on the most detailed area.

Soft off-white backdrop visible in unfocused areas. Warm color grading enhancing the richness of chocolate, the freshness of fruit, or the elegance of cream tones. Tactile, luxurious quality - the viewer should almost feel the texture. Macro food photography aesthetic, 8k resolution.

**İdeal Kullanım:** Lifestyle context (el olmadan), cafe/patisserie atmosferi, brand storytelling
**Kompozisyon:** Ürün + minimal servis props, ortam önerisi

### DALL-E 3

```
Using uploaded image(s) as reference for the pastry presentation.

Contextual still life composition suggesting a serving moment, 9:16 vertical aspect ratio. Pastry placed on appropriate serveware: white ceramic plate for elegant pastries, wooden board for rustic styles, slate for modern presentations, or glass stand for showcase pieces. AI should match serveware to pastry style.

A dessert fork or small spoon positioned beside (not touching) the pastry. A simple white or cream napkin folded nearby. Background includes soft blur suggesting patisserie environment - perhaps a second plate or cup barely visible.

Light marble, cream stone, or light wood surface based on pastry formality. Soft off-white backdrop. Natural window light from left, warm and inviting. Warm color palette with cream, white, and pastry's natural tones. Shallow depth of field keeping pastry sharp, context elements softly blurred. Inviting, refined atmosphere without human presence. 8k quality.
