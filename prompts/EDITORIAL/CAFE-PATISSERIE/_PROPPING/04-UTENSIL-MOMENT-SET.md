## DALL-E 3 PROMPT (Fork Moment)

```
Using uploaded image(s) as reference for the pastry/dessert.

9:16 vertical composition. [PASTRY] on white ceramic plate, positioned center-lower. A small dessert fork resting on the plate edge at an angle - positioned as if just set down after taking a bite, not perfectly aligned.

A small piece or bite visibly removed from the pastry, revealing interior texture/layers. A few crumbs on the plate suggesting recent interaction.

Light marble or cream surface. Cream linen napkin loosely placed at frame edge. Natural side light from left.

The moment just after first taste - implied human presence without showing hands. Inviting, appetizing, "couldn't resist" feeling. Off-white backdrop.

Shallow depth of field: pastry and fork sharp, background soft. 8k quality.

--no human hands, fingers, perfectly arranged utensils, untouched food, dark background

## VARYASYON: Pasta Servisi (Cake Server)

```
Using uploaded image(s) as reference for the cake/tart.

9:16 vertical composition. [CAKE/TART] on white serving plate, one slice already removed creating a gap. A vintage-style cake server (silver or brass) resting beside, showing evidence of use - a small smear of cream or filling on its surface.

The removed slice positioned on a smaller plate in soft blur at frame edge (optional). Crumbs scattered naturally where the slice was cut.

Cream tablecloth or marble surface. Soft natural light from left illuminating the cake's interior layers revealed by the cut. Off-white backdrop.

Serving moment frozen: hospitality implied, celebration suggested. Warm elegant mood. Shallow depth of field.

8k quality.

--no hands serving, plastic utensils, disposable plates, dark background
```

---

## VARYASYON: Spoon Scoop (Mousse/Cremeux)

```
Using uploaded image(s) as reference for the mousse/cremeux dessert.

9:16 vertical composition. Individual [MOUSSE/DESSERT] in elegant glass or ceramic vessel, positioned center-lower. A small spoon resting in or beside the dessert, showing a scoop taken - revealing the creamy interior texture.

The spoon's bowl holds a small amount of the dessert, suggesting mid-eating moment. The surface of the dessert shows the beautiful disruption of the scoop.

Simple plate or saucer underneath. Minimal surface - light marble or white. Soft diffused light. Off-white backdrop.

Intimate dessert moment: texture revealed, appetite triggered. Shallow depth of field focusing on the scoop area.

8k quality.

--no drips, messy spills, multiple scoops, empty vessel, dark background
```

## POZİSYON REHBERİ

### Çatal/Kaşık Yerleşimi
```
❌ Perfectly parallel to plate edge (too staged)
❌ Pointing directly at camera (aggressive)
❌ Far from food (disconnected)

✅ Angled 15-30° on plate edge (casual, just-set-down)
✅ Touching or nearly touching food (intimate)
✅ Slightly overlapping plate rim (natural)
```

### "Bite Taken" Pozisyonu
```
❌ Perfect geometric slice removed
❌ Multiple bites (too messy)
❌ Center bite (unnatural)

✅ Edge bite or corner (natural first-bite spot)
✅ Single clean-ish bite (appetizing)
✅ Revealing interior texture (storytelling)
```

## YASAKLAR

```

perfectly arranged cutlery, pristine untouched food, knife and fork
crossed formally, utensils in hand, dark or black utensils
